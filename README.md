Womens 2023 Datathon: US Greenspaces &amp; Wellbeing Presented by Correlation One
Background
As our day to day lives become more integrated with technology, it is important to reflect on the hard-wired positive influences that nature has on humans. Greenspaces provide myriad benefits to human mental and physical health at the individual level, as they can reduce stress and provide areas for physical recreation. Additionally, greenspaces are good for humans collectively, as they help to cool cities and reduce overall noise levels, among other benefits. It is important that we as a society recognize and study the benefits of greenspaces as they may lead to prescribable life-style changes that can be adopted to improve our individual and collective well-being!
Today, the Correlation One staff has prepared a rich collection of datasets on accessible greenspaces and urban forests across the US. In addition, we have provided data from the CDC on mental and physical health. Our hope is that your work during this datathon will shed light on the specific and measurable ways that human health is affected by access to greenspaces.
